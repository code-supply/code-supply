See it [on GitHub](https://github.com/code-supply/deps_nix) or
[HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/deps_nix).

Like [mix2nix](https://github.com/ydlr/mix2nix), but using a different
approach, and aiming for features that haven't been implemented in other
Beam-related Nix derivation translators.

Supports git dependencies and environment/package cherry-picking, which mix2nix
currently lacks.
